\section{Previous work}
%Write about other papers and how they have solved the problem.

\section{Problem}
%Describe our limited version of the problem.
%Describe the two problems, one is recognizing characters and the other is to recognize words.
%1. Images have strokes of width 1.
%2. Assume characters segment in word.

\section{Method}\label{sec:method}
%2. General overview of our implementation.   Kjell
%	Two classifiers
%		What they are doing
%3. Add picture describing implementation.  Kjell

%1. Describe HMM, short overview. Chongyang
%1 Picture of HMM topology
%4. Describe the different initialization algos, advantages and disadvantages. Chongyang
%1.1Topology of HMM Chongyang
%1.2 prevention of underflow. Chongyang
%1.3 Handle zeros in denominator. Chongyang 




\subsection{Dataset}\label{sec:dataset}
%1. Write about creation of sample data. Chongyang
%2. Could not find good dataset. Chongyang
%3. Write down how much data we had. Chongyang
%4. Write about how the word examples are generated

\subsection{Preprocessing}
%1. Write about scaling of picture. Kjell
%2. Segmentation of picture. Kjell

\section{Result}\label{sec:result}
%1. (Started Kjell) Test of different initialization methods and number of training examples for word recognition 
%1. (Started Kjell) Test of different initialization methods and number of training examples for word recognition
%1. Maybe result from character test using different initialization algos.
%2. Basic results from testing the implementation
%3. (Better to do in appendix? Kjell) Depending on how much other results we have, discuss experience of playing around with the gui.

\input{result}

\section{Discussion}
%1. Discuss the results.
%2. Discuss importance of amount of training data and the effects on performance.
%3. Discuss possibility of training words with data from character classification
%4. Discuss how our approach might work for word recognition

\section{Future Work}
%1. Discuss what other test would be interesting to perform
%2. How can the classifier be improved. More features and real training data for the words?
